		<td><h3>What if everything was this transparent?</h3><font size="3">Government works better with well informed constituents. In many cases, formal requests are required to get government spending details. We want to eliminate the need for these requests, by putting government finances online. <br />Today, many federal, state, and local governments are lacking quality public financial data. <a href="/blog/2017-12-16-transparency-scorecard">See our report</a>. Just in the US states, our governments are trillions in debt with little public awareness. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.truthinaccounting.org/news/detail/why-is-truthful-timely-and-transparent-financial-data-important-details">See the report</a>. To publish the complex web of interconnected financial systems, we need collaborative data standards for data-driven decision making. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.workiva.com/sites/workiva/files/pdfs/thought-leadership/unleashing-power-financial-data-state-local-government-whitepaper-20180314-j40506.pdf">See the report</a>.
