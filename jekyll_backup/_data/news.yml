    date: 2018-03-14
    author:  C. Christina Ho and Dean Ritz
    publisher: Workiva
    excerpt: Tracking the flow of money within the U.S. Government is difficult because the government’s financial system is decentralized, with money flowing from the federal government to many state and local entities. However, if each level of government adopted open data principles, over time the government could track the flow of money between these disparate systems, thereby facilitating clear, transparent models of spending and performance.

When it comes to budget data, agencies get about a “C.” GAO is 95 percent confident that three-quarters of the website data matches agency records. But on contracts and grants spending, forget about it. GAO found that between 0 and 1 percent of posted data matches agency records.

    excerpt: To be informed participants in their governments, citizens must be provided with truthful and transparent information. States’ efforts to begin digging out from their current financial holes must start with honest government accounting. Only then can responsible alternatives to place the state on solid financial footing be developed and debated. An informed electorate is essential to a democratic system of government, and citizens have not received the financial information needed to be knowledgeable participants in their governments.

    publisher: Pew Research Center
    excerpt: Government reformers and advocates believe that two contemporary phenomena hold the potential to change how people engage with governments at all levels. The first is data. There is more of it than ever before and there are more effective tools for sharing it. This creates new service-delivery possibilities for government through use of data that government agencies themselves collect and generate. The second is public desire to make government more responsive, transparent and effective in serving citizens — an impulse driven by tight budgets and declining citizens’ trust in government.
