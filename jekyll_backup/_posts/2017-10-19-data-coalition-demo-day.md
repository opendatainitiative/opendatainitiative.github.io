The Data Demo Day is free for all attendees! Reserve your seat here.  

The half day event will explore how California state agencies and local 
governments are modernizing the way they manage information. By collecting 
and sharing information as open data, governments can be transparent to 
the Californians they serve - and also become more efficient through 
internal analytics. Join us!

Jan Ross, Deputy Treasurer for Technology and Innovation, 
California State Treasurer's Office; Hudson Hollister, Executive Director, 
Data Coalition; Graeme Finley, Principal, Grant Thornton; Ari Hershowitz,
