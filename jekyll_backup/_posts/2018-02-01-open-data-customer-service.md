### Customer Service Wins Open Data Cities

Over the past four years, the Ohio Treasury Office has developed a large community of cities, townships, schools, and agencies working together with their open data leadership. After the Ohio open data portal, http://ohiocheckbook.com/ was established online, they needed their sources of data to participate. Without fresh information, an open data portal becomes irrelevant. To avoid this possibility, they made success happen through hard work in the trenches working directly with their customers and partners to onboard and support. Their focus on customer service has built up a network of government organizations participating in government financial transparency.

### Policy Becomes Legislation For Long Term Success
A key aspect of the Ohio success has been good policy that enabled the customer service approach yielding results. The policy came from the Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandell and the Ohio Treasury Office staff like Director Frank Kohstall. However, policy is not law. To make important aspects of the Ohio open data success continue past the current administration, policy needs to become legislation. Ohio House Representative Mike Duffey has been working to pass open data legislation for the past few years. He sponsored <a href="http://localhost:4000/legislation-review/2018-01-25-ohio-hb3-legislation-review/">Ohio Legislation HB3</a> to codify the existing policy into law. The bill is currently pending a vote in the Ohio House.

For this Next Steps discussion, we got together Representative Mike Duffey, Ohio Treasury Office Director of Public Affairs Frank Kohstall, Research Fellow Buckeye Institute Greg Lawson, Sunlight Foundation Open Cities Analyst Noel Isama, Data Coalition Policy Director Christian Hoehner, and a couple of additional staff members.
