Some useful resources ODI has improved recently:

* The website sections on work, resources, and news are all updated
* Legislation index with scoring <a href="https://opendatainitiative.github.io/legislation"><u>https://opendatainitiative.github.io/legislation</u></a>
* Transparency index with scoring <a href="https://opendatainitiative.github.io/transparency"><u>https://opendatainitiative.github.io/transparency</u></a>

We have organized the resources for city officials on what they need to be successful using ODI best practices, legislation, and transparency. Following the list provides a city information to make decisions on their open data development. What Works and the Sunlight Foundation are available to provide hands on help to establish cities' open data policies and implementation plans.
	
We are working on the resources for state legislators and agencies on how Treasury / Finance / Auditor organizations can be successful using ODI best practices, legislation, and transparency resources. State agency utilization of ODI resources here will lead them into working closely with PIRG to raise their state financial transparency score.

By end of March, we will publish resources for constituents very similar to what gets used for Open Data Day events. We will explain using these open data resources like data.world to provide access to where the data is, what tools are available, and how to make actionable results. I participated in the Walnut Creek, CA, US open data event on 02 March. Data.world, Github, D3, and Tableau were all used heavily. Expect we will lean on these resources from this recent experience.
