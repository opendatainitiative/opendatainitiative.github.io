# Open Data Initiative Website

## About

The Open Data Initiative website is a Next.js-powered platform dedicated to reviewing government transparency and policies with a focus on Northern California. 

The Federal DOGE seems like a good model to start with. Follow where the costs are. We can follow DOGE's progress and adopt their methods and approach where appropriate. 

Following Chamath Palihapitiyaâ€™s analogy of government spending as a three layer onion:

# people: review headcounts and their job titles. what is theit purpose and fuunction.
# Infrastructure: building leases. many are on 1 year leases and remain largely unused and empty. 
# Service and IT: this area might be an interesting place find spending as it is generally overlooked. these contracts can be large and long lasting.

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality, Coverage

- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support and Next.js core web vitals rules
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky enforces linting and testing on the master branch
- **Code Style**: Follows Next.js best practices and React patterns
- **Coverage**: tracking available via `npm run test:coverage`

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Branch Strategy**:
  - `master`: Production-ready code
  - `develop`: Integration branch for feature development
  - branches should branch from and merge back to `develop`

- **Steps**
   - Dev: local code creation, packaging and unit tests as pre-commit before commiting  to `develop`
   - Stage: on 'develop' PR creation, runs integration and security tests
   - Once 'develop' code is considered ready for release, then commit changes to 'master'
   - Preview: on 'master' PR creation, runs e2e tests
   - Production: on 'master' PR merge, triggers deployment to production

- **Environments**
   - localhost (dev)
   - Github runners (stage)
   - Vercel (preview, production)
