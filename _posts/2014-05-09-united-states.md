113th Congress

                                 An Act


 
  To expand the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 
 2006 to increase accountability and transparency in Federal spending, 
       and for other purposes. <<NOTE: May 9, 2014 -  [S. 994]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Digital 
Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014. 31 USC 6101 note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Accountability and 
Transparency Act of 2014'' or the ``DATA Act''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 31 USC 6101 note.>>  PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) expand the Federal Funding Accountability and 
        Transparency Act of 2006 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note) by disclosing 
        direct Federal agency expenditures and linking Federal contract, 
        loan, and grant spending information to programs of Federal 
        agencies to enable taxpayers and policy makers to track Federal 
        spending more effectively;
            (2) establish Government-wide data standards for financial 
        data and provide consistent, reliable, and searchable 
        Government-wide spending data that is displayed accurately for 
        taxpayers and policy makers on USASpending.gov (or a successor 
        system that displays the data);
            (3) simplify reporting for entities receiving Federal funds 
        by streamlining reporting requirements and reducing compliance 
        costs while improving transparency;
            (4) improve the quality of data submitted to USASpending.gov 
        by holding Federal agencies accountable for the completeness and 
        accuracy of the data submitted; and
            (5) apply approaches developed by the Recovery 
        Accountability and Transparency Board to spending across the 
        Federal Government.
