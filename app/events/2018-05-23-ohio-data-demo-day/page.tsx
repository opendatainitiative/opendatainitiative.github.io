          The U.S. Public Research Interest Group (PIRG) is a federation of state Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs) that annually publishes a report rating all 50 US states on providing online access to government spending data. This report is widely used as the best assessment available on state financial transparency. In 2013, PIRG ranked Ohio 46th in the nation for government financial data transparency. Ohio's Treasurer Josh Mandel took Ohio's poor ranking as a challenge and set forth to make a change. To accomplish this, Treasurer Mandel built OhioCheckbook.com which for the first time in state history put every dollar spent online in a searchable database.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As a result of OhioCheckbook.com, U.S. PIRG announced in March 2015 that Treasurer Mandel and the Ohio Office of the Treasurer had earned Ohio the number one transparency ranking in the country for providing online access to government spending data. Ohio climbed from 46th to 1st in the country, and OhioCheckbook.com received a perfect score of 100 points â€“ the highest score in the history of the U.S. PIRG transparency rankings. However, this was only the beginning of the important work that needed to be accomplished, the hard work of onboarding Ohio municipalities remained. Since then, the Ohio Office of the Treasurer has tackled this problem in partnership with the Ohio local governments and schools, onboarding 1,200 organizations.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Despite the success, significant hurdles remain. Thousands of Ohio government organizations are not participating with OhioCheckbook.com, accounting standards have yet to be broadly standardized and accepted, and the current Ohio Treasury leadership is leaving office.

        <p className="mb-8">
          Join us for a morning of talks and panels from 8am to 1:30pm, 23 May 2018, explaining the history and benefits of Ohio government financial transparency and an optimistic view of Ohio government's open data future.
