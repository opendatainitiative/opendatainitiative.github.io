      <p>
        State support of government financial transparency is critical for the success of the cities' open data implementations. Every city has financial reporting responsibilities to their state and likely to the <a href="http://gasb.org/" target="_blank">Governmental Accounting Standards Board</a>. This makes working with these critical oversight organizations an important part of every city's responsibilities. Each state's success with their own open data portals directly impacts their cities through standards, audits, reporting, and collaboration. The Open Data Initiative is working to bridge the gaps in government financial transparency implementations between the city, state, and federal levels.

        Our partner, the Data Coalition, has been working to implement open data at the Federal level for years, so there are many references to their resources here. The people of the Data Coalition helped to pass the <a href="http://www.datacoalition.org/issues/data-act/" target="_blank">The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014</a> (DATA Act) <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ101/pdf/PLAW-113publ101.pdf" target="_blank">(PL 113-101)</a> which provided an example to the nation of the United States how government transparency could work on a large scale. This is a scaled down, stepwise version of the open data resources available from many sources.
