      <h1>United States DATA Act Legislation Review</h1>
      <p>By Sean Roberts - March 9, 2018</p>

      <p>
        There are many references to data quality and 'holding federal agencies accountable for the completeness and accuracy of the data submitted'. 
        Unfortunately, without more standards and specifics in the bill, each agency is allowed to define their own version of quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a good faith effort to keep the quantity of the open data transparency at a high level by including the agency data publishing requirement of 
        'not later than three years after the enactment of this Act and monthly, when practicable, but not less than quarterly thereafter'
      </p>

      <p>
        More review necessary of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 and the work of the Recovery Accountability and 
        Transparency Board to verify if this updates the legislative score.
