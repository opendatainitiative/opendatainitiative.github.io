**Notes:**
- The Department of Education has notably shifted funding from DEI-focused NGOs to charter schools, reflecting a policy change that might align with the ideologies of conservative activists like Chris Rufo.
- USAID's operations include substantial NGO funding for humanitarian efforts, which have come under review or potential reorientation, possibly influenced by similar political or ideological shifts in federal funding priorities. 
- The redirection of funds and oversight by entities like DOGE could indicate a broader strategy to align federal spending with certain political objectives, impacting how NGOs and state programs interact with federal agencies.
