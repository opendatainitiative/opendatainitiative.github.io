**Notes:**
- The Department of Education's activities have been notably restructured, with significant cuts to grants supporting DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives and a focus on reallocating funds to charter school programs. 
- The termination of contracts and grants seems part of a broader strategy to shift funding priorities, possibly influenced by political directives or policy changes.
- The involvement of DOGE in accessing and possibly redirecting funds suggests a focus on oversight or reallocation of educational funding, which could affect state programs and NGO partnerships.
- USAID's connection with NGOs in funding humanitarian projects indicates a potential area for further scrutiny or redirection under the current administration's policies.

This update follows the money trail by highlighting how federal funds are being managed or redirected, especially in the context of educational grants and NGO support.
