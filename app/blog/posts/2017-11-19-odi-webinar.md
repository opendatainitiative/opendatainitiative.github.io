On November 29th, Lincoln hosted a webinar with the Open Data Initiative 
Project Leader Sean Roberts. All about the Open Data Initiative, why it 
matters, and how you can get involved. Viewers had the chance to 
ask questions during Q&A. 

Sean overviewed of the current state of open data in the US before 
diving into ODIâ€™s projects: from our current pilot program (in 
partnership with the California Policy Center and the Data Coalition) 
to future plans for improving government data management practices.
