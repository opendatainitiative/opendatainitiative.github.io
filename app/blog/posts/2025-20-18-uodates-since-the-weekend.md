# Ongoing Efforts
Since the weekend of February 15-16, 2025, DOGE has focused on continuing its efficiency initiatives. They are working with agencies to simplify the credit card program, which involves 4.6 million active cards processing $40 billion in FY24, and plan to report back in one week. They are also seeking public input to identify waste, fraud, and abuse through their X affiliate accounts.

# Previous Findings
Before February 16, 2025, DOGe made significant strides, including cancelling 586 wasteful contracts for a $445 million saving and recovering $1.9 billion in misplaced HUD funds, redirecting these to assist homeless veterans and others. They also cancelled specific spending, such as $10 million for Mozambique and $9.7 million for UC Berkeley's Cambodian youth program.
