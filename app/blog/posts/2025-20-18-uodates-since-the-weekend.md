### Comprehensive Analysis of DOGe's Findings on Waste, Fraud, and Abuse

This section provides a detailed examination of the efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGe), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, to identify and address waste, fraud, and abuse, particularly since February 16, 2025, based on available public information. The analysis includes methodologies, key findings from recent searches, and the broader context of DOGe's activities, ensuring a comprehensive understanding.

#### Background and Context
DOGe is a temporary advisory body established by Executive Order on January 20, 2025 ([Establishing And Implementing The President's "Department Of Government Efficiency"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/)), operating within the United States DOGe Service (formerly the United States Digital Service). Its mission is to improve government efficiency by identifying wasteful spending, cutting regulations, and recommending reforms, with a termination date of July 4, 2026 ([Department of Government Efficiency - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Government_Efficiency)). DOGe uses its X platform to publicize findings and solicit public input ([How the Dept. of Government Efficiency Will Use Its Platform](https://capstonedc.com/insights/how-the-dept-of-government-efficiency-will-use-its-platform/)).

The inquiry focused on findings since February 16, 2025, covering X posts from DOGe's account (@DOGE), Elon Musk's account (@elonmusk), and affiliate accounts (e.g., @DOGE_USDA, @DOGE_HUD), as well as the DOGe website ([DOGE: Department of Government Efficiency](https://doge.gov/)). Searches included X queries for posts mentioning waste, fraud, or abuse, and web searches for recent reports, with multiple iterations to refine results.

#### Methodology
The process involved:
- X searches for posts from @DOGE, @elonmusk, and affiliate accounts since February 16, 2025, using keywords like "waste," "fraud," and "abuse."
- Browsing the DOGe website for recent findings or actions, particularly under "wall of receipts" or updates.
- Web searches for news articles or reports on DOGe's findings since February 16, 2025, to capture any announcements.

Initial searches returned older posts, leading to focused efforts on affiliate accounts and specific X queries. The analysis considered both direct announcements and ongoing efforts, ensuring a strict superset of the direct answer content.

#### Findings Since February 16, 2025
No new specific findings of waste, fraud, or abuse were announced by DOGe since February 16, 2025. However, the following activities were noted:

1. **Credit Card Program Review:**
   - On February 18, 2025, at 19:26 PST, DOGe posted on X about the government's credit card usage, noting approximately 4.6 million active credit cards/accounts processed about 90 million unique transactions for roughly $40 billion in FY24 ([DOGE X Post on Credit Card Program](https://x.com/doge/status/1892053072169275822)). They are working with agencies to simplify the program and reduce administrative costs, with a promise to report back in one week.

2. **Public Input Solicitation:**
   - On February 16, 2025, at 16:49 PST, DOGe sought help from the general public via X, asking for insights on reducing waste, fraud, and abuse through DMs to affiliate accounts like @DOGE_USDA and @DOGE_SSA ([DOGE X Post on Public Input](https://x.com/doge/status/1891288881674240070)).
   - @DOGE_USDA posted on February 16, 2025, at 20:03 PST, seeking public input on USDA-related waste, fraud, and abuse ([DOGE_USDA X Post on Public Input](https://x.com/DOGE_USDA/status/1891337678894899321)).
   - @DOGE_HUD posted on February 17, 2025, at 08:42 PST, seeking public input on HUD-related issues ([DOGE_HUD X Post on Public Input](https://x.com/DOGE_HUD/status/1891528537791713418)).

3. **Other Observations:**
   - On February 16, 2025, at 21:15 PST, DOGe posted "Looking into this" on X, but without context, it was unclear what was being investigated ([DOGE X Post "Looking into this"](https://x.com/doge/status/1891355681879421171)).
   - Elon Musk posted on February 16, 2025, at 18:20 PST, asking the public to DM DOGE handles to report government waste and fraud, but no specific findings were mentioned ([Elon Musk X Post on Reporting Waste](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891311772348399729)).

These activities indicate ongoing efforts but no new specific instances of waste, fraud, or abuse identified since February 16, 2025.

#### Previous Findings (Before February 16, 2025)
To provide context, DOGe's earlier actions include significant findings, which may be relevant to ongoing efforts:

1. **Contract Cancellations:**
   - DOGe cancelled 586 wasteful contracts, with a ceiling value of $2.1 billion, saving $445 million. This includes an $8.2 million contract at the USDA for teaching minorities how to be farmers, deemed unnecessary ([DOGE X Post on Contract Cancellations](https://x.com/doge/status/1890593889314038216), dated February 15, 2025, before the cutoff).

2. **Recovery of Misplaced Funds:**
   - DOGe recovered $1.9 billion in funds from HUD that were misplaced during the Biden administration, fixed by Secretary Turner and DOGe, and redirected to help homeless veterans and other Americans ([DOGE X Post on HUD Funds Recovery](https://x.com/doge/status/1890501342931628266), dated February 14, 2025).

3. **Cancelled Specific Spending:**
   - DOGe cancelled spending on several programs, including:
     - $10 million for "voluntary medical male circumcision" in Mozambique.
     - $9.7 million for UC Berkeley's Cambodian youth program.
     - $2.3 million for an unspecified "strengthening" program, lacking clear justification ([DOGE X Post on Cancelled Spending](https://x.com/doge/status/1890849405932077378), dated February 15, 2025).

These findings, while before February 16, 2025, highlight DOGe's focus areas and may be part of ongoing efforts.

#### Detailed Search Results and Analysis
The search process involved multiple iterations:
- X searches for @DOGE posts since February 16, 2025, returned three posts: the public input request, "Looking into this," and the credit card program review.
- Affiliate account searches (@DOGE_USDA, @DOGE_HUD) showed only public input requests, no specific findings.
- Elon Musk's posts mentioned reporting waste but no specific findings.
- Browsing the DOGe website ([DOGE: Department of Government Efficiency](https://doge.gov/)) and "wall of receipts" (resulted in a 404 error) showed no actions after February 16, 2025.
- Web searches for "DOGe findings since February 16, 2025" returned articles from before the date, focusing on earlier actions like DEI contract cancellations.

The lack of new findings since February 16, 2025, suggests DOGe is in an ongoing review phase, with the credit card program being a key area of focus.

#### Tables of Key Data
To organize the findings, the following tables summarize the activities and amounts involved:

**Findings Before February 16, 2025:**

|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Contract Cancellations            | 586 wasteful contracts cancelled, includes $8.2M USDA contract              | $445M in savings            | Feb 15, 2025                 |
| Misplaced Funds Recovered         | HUD funds recovered after being misplaced during Biden administration       | $1.9 billion                | Feb 14, 2025                 |
| Cancelled Spending                | $10M for Mozambique circumcisions, $9.7M for UC Berkeley Cambodian youth   | $21.7M total                | Feb 15, 2025                 |

**Activities Since February 16, 2025:**

| **Category**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Amount Involved**         | **Date**                     |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Credit Card Program Review        | Working to simplify program, 4.6M cards, $40B FY24 spend, report in 1 week | -                           | Feb 18, 2025                 |
| Public Input Solicitation         | Seeking insights on waste, fraud, abuse via DM to affiliates                | -                           | Feb 16, 2025                 |

These tables highlight the lack of new specific findings since February 16, 2025, with a focus on ongoing reviews.

#### Conclusion and Implications
The absence of new specific findings since February 16, 2025, indicates that DOGe is in a phase of ongoing investigations and public engagement, with the credit card program review being a notable area. The recovery of $1.9 billion in HUD funds before this date is a significant achievement, reflecting the scale of their efforts. The user's reference to "tweets from both accounts" may suggest they saw earlier posts or expected more immediate findings, but based on available data, no new instances have been announced in the specified period.

This analysis ensures all relevant details from the search process are included, offering a comprehensive view for understanding DOGe's recent and ongoing efforts on waste, fraud, and abuse.
