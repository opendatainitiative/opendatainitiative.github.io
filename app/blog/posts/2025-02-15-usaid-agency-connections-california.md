# USAID's Collaborative History with California-Based Entities

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has a long-standing history of collaborating with academic institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private sector partners in California. These partnerships have focused on global development challenges, ranging from health and education to economic growth and technological innovation. Below is a detailed analysis of USAID’s engagements with California-related entities, structured by organizational type and programmatic focus.

---

## Academic Partnerships in California

### University of California System
The University of California (UC) system has been a cornerstone of USAID’s research and implementation efforts. Key collaborations include:
- **UC Berkeley**: The Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) at UC Berkeley led the **Promoting Impact and Learning with Cost-Effectiveness Evidence (PILCEE)** initiative, a $75 million USAID-funded program to enhance the cost-effectiveness of global poverty alleviation efforts[9][16]. Additionally, UC Berkeley’s Blum Center for Developing Economies managed the **USAID Digital Workforce Development Program** in Cambodia, recognized for its user-centric approach to ICT education[38].
- **UC San Diego**: Partnered with USAID on the **Agency for All Project**, a $38 million initiative to study agency and empowerment in low- and middle-income countries[7][32]. The university’s School of Global Policy and Strategy also contributed to PILCEE, focusing on cost-effectiveness analysis[16].
- **UC Davis**: Led the **Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Markets, Risk, and Resilience (MRR)**, a $30 million program to address rural poverty through evidence-based interventions[36]. This built on prior USAID-funded work under the **Assets and Market Access Innovation Lab**[36].

### Stanford University
Stanford’s research institutions have collaborated with USAID on global health and technology initiatives, including partnerships with the Center on Gender Equity and Health (GEH) and private-sector tech companies[37].

### Other Institutions
- **San Diego State University** and **University of Southern California** participated in USAID-funded projects related to disaster response and humanitarian aid[49].
- **California State Universities** and private institutions like **Santa Clara University** have engaged in USAID’s global health programs, particularly in HIV/AIDS prevention and maternal health[37].

## NGO Collaborations

### Save the Children
The U.S. branch of Save the Children, headquartered in California, partnered with UC San Diego on the **Agency for All Project**, which aimed to integrate social and behavioral research into USAID’s health programs[7][32]. The organization also collaborated on USAID’s **Child Survival Campaigns**, emphasizing community health worker training[42].

### CARE International
CARE’s California-based teams contributed to USAID’s **Global Health Supply Chain Program**, improving access to medical supplies in conflict zones[34]. This included leveraging California’s tech sector for logistics innovations[37].

### Catholic Relief Services (CRS)
As one of USAID’s largest NGO partners, CRS received $4.6 billion in funding from 2013–2022 for global humanitarian programs[45]. While headquartered in Maryland, CRS’s California offices facilitated disaster relief operations in partnership with USAID, such as post-earthquake recovery in Nepal and Haiti[11].

---

## Private Sector and Innovation Initiatives

### Silicon Valley Tech Firms
- **Google, Facebook, and Intel** collaborated with USAID on digital literacy programs and connectivity projects in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia[37].
- **Cepheid** (a Danaher subsidiary) worked with USAID to deploy rapid diagnostic tools for tuberculosis and HIV in resource-limited settings[37].

### Agricultural and Environmental Partnerships
- **36 California-based farmers** participated in USAID’s **Feed the Future** initiatives, sharing sustainable agriculture practices with smallholder farmers in Africa and Latin America[49].
- **The Lemelson Foundation** (Oregon/California) partnered with USAID to promote clean energy technologies in India and Kenya[37].

---

## State Programs and Commissions

While USAID’s direct engagement with California state agencies is limited, indirect collaborations exist through:
- **California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA)**: Supported USAID’s climate resilience programs in Central America via technical exchanges on water management[49].
- **California Victim Compensation Board**: Contributed expertise to USAID’s justice sector reforms in post-conflict regions like Colombia and Iraq[49].

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite its partnerships, USAID’s work in California has faced scrutiny:
- **Ethical Concerns**: The 2024 child sex abuse scandal involving a USAID-funded Kenyan orphanage raised questions about oversight of California-based subcontractors[41].
- **Political Instrumentalization**: Programs like **ZunZuneo** (a covert social media project in Cuba) involved California tech firms, sparking debates about the ethical use of aid for political objectives[1][41].

---

## Conclusion

USAID’s collaboration with California entities has been multifaceted, leveraging the state’s academic rigor, technological innovation, and NGO expertise to advance global development goals. While these partnerships have driven progress in health, agriculture, and disaster response, they also underscore the need for robust oversight to align with ethical and strategic priorities. As USAID faces structural changes under the second Trump administration, the future of these partnerships remains uncertain, with implications for both global development and California’s role in U.S. foreign policy.
